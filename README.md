##Simulated Annealing heuristic for solving the Ising spin glass ground state problem

Steps
-----
- Clone this Github Gist by:
  git clone https://gist.github.com/9e6cec4bb0f8ee826fcd.git

- Launch the Simulated Annealer for comparing the success probabilities:
  ```bash launch.sh -p```
  or
  ```bash launch.sh --probability```

- Launch the Simulated Annealer to note the running time:
  ```bash launch.sh -t```
  or
  ```bash launch.sh --time```
